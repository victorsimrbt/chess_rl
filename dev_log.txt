Looking at keras examples of Deep Q network. Testing adapting code by creating chess env. Set action to be the 4096 array.

Deep Q Learning functional. Sparse rewards might be problem. Q learning playing its own moves seems to be problematic.
Need to create system of splitting rewards for white and black.

Cleaner Coding. Rewards split for white and black. Planning on adding material counter system.

Reward Evaluation flexibility. Exporting newest versions to a new colab notebook for GPU usage.

Decided To Not add Stockfish. Took long break from project. Considering advancing network architecture (ResNET). Monte Carlo Tree
Use Value + Policy Network
